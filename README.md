Sample UI Project for Divinity: Original Sin 2 - Definitive Edition
=======

This is a sample project to get up and running with creating a GUI for DOS2DE.

The default variables in MainTimeline.as are configured for automatically stretching the UI to the screen size, but this can be tweaked for the regular "fixed" layout setups ("fixed" for the layout and "center" for the anchor positions).
